      option because it offers great support and cushioning. It has a ClutchFit

  - question: Do The Running Shoes For Piriformis Syndrome Beneficial?
    answer: Yes! A good pair of running shoes can be really beneficial for people
      with piriformis syndrome. In fact, a lot of runners actually experience
      this condition because of the constant pounding their feet take. So if
      you're suffering from piriformis syndrome, make sure to invest in a good
      pair of running shoes and see if that helps relieve your symptoms.
  - question: Do The Running Shoes For Piriformis Syndrome Reduce Pain?
    answer: The right running shoes can actually help reduce the pain associated
      with piriformis syndrome. This is because they provide ample support and
      cushioning to the iliotibial band (ITB) and other muscles and ligaments in
      the lower body, which take a pounding when running. Additionally,
      motion-control shoes can help control excessive pronation (foot roll)
      which can worsen symptoms.
