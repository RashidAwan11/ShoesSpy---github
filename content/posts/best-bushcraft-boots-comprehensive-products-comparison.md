      ### **Comfort:**


      We wore each pair of boots for a full day to get a feel for their comfort level. We took into account the weight of the boot, the padding, and the support.


      ### **Durability:**


      We put each boot through a series of tests to see how well they held up. We scraped them against rough surfaces, stepped on sharp objects, and flexed them repeatedly.


      ### **Water Resistance:**


      We tested each boot's water resistance by submerging them in water and then walking in them. We also sprayed them with a hose to see how well they repelled water.


      ### **Traction:**


      We evaluated the traction of each boot by walking on slippery and uneven surfaces. We also tested them in mud and snow to see how well they gripped the ground.


      ### **Result:**


      After putting each boot through our rigorous testing, we came to the conclusion that the following top 6 boots are extremely comfortable, durable, water-resistant, and provide great traction on various surfaces. We arrange them from high ratings to low based on our testing results. We would highly recommend them.
