## **How To Use The Rockport Shoe Size Chart?**

To find your perfect fit using the shoe size chart, simply follow these easy steps: 

First, determine what size you should order by measuring your foot. To do this, place a ruler horizontally on the floor and stand with your heel against the wall and your longest toe pointing forward. Then, measure from the end of your heel to the tip of your longest toe to get your foot’s length in inches or centimeters. 

Once you have that measurement, refer to the Rockport shoe size chart to find the corresponding men’s or women’s size. For example, if you measured a foot length of 9 inches (23 cm), you would wear a men’s size 8 or a women’s size 10. 

If you’re between sizes, it’s usually best to order the larger size for a comfortable fit. And if you have wide feet, make sure to select the “wide” option when available.

## **Conclusion:**

Although Rockport offers a variety of sizes, it can be tricky to determine which size shoe you need. The Rockport shoe size chart provides an easy-to-use guide to help you find the perfect fit for your feet. With this information in hand, you're sure to have a comfortable and stylish experience when shopping for shoes from this iconic brand. Have you tried out the Rockport size chart before?
